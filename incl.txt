<p>This is just some text to demonstrate the %INCLUDE functionality in QBASDOWN.</p>
<p>This functionality is there mainly to include blocks of complicated HTML that was generated by another program. Included files are passed through exactly as-is, with no further processing.</p>
<p>The %INCLUDE function is ignored if it occurs on the first three lines - those are reserved for Pandoc-style headers.</p>
